<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>GeoDCAT-AP is an extension of the DCAT application profile for data portals in Europe (DCAT-AP) for describing geospatial datasets, dataset series, and services. Its basic use case is to make spatial datasets, dataset series, and services searchable on general data portals, thereby making geospatial information better findable across borders and sectors. For this purpose, GeoDCAT-AP provides an RDF vocabulary and the corresponding RDF syntax binding for the union of metadata elements of the core profile of ISO 19115:2003 and those defined in the framework of the <abbr title="Infrastructure for spatial information in Europe">INSPIRE</abbr> Directive of the European Union.</p>
<p>This document is the result of the major change release process described in the Change and Release Management Policy for DCAT-AP and was built starting from GeoDCAT-AP version 1.0.1.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!--
<div class="issue" data-number="123"></div>
-->

<p>This document contains version 2.0.0 of the specification for GeoDCAT-AP, an extension of the DCAT application profile for data portals in Europe (DCAT-AP) [[DCAT-AP]] for describing geospatial datasets, dataset series, and services.</p>
<p>Its basic use case is to make spatial datasets, dataset series, and services searchable on general data portals, thereby making geospatial information better findable across borders and sectors. For this purpose, GeoDCAT-AP provides an RDF vocabulary and the corresponding RDF syntax binding for the union of metadata elements of the core profile of ISO 19115:2003 [[ISO-19115]] and those defined in the framework of the INSPIRE Directive [[INSPIRE-DIR]].</p>
<p><strong>The GeoDCAT-AP specification does not replace the INSPIRE Metadata Regulation</strong> [[?INSPIRE-MD-REG]] <strong>nor the INSPIRE Metadata technical guidelines</strong> [[INSPIRE-MD]] <strong>based on ISO 19115 and ISO 19119.</strong> Its purpose is to give owners of geospatial metadata the possibility to achieve more by providing the means of an <em>additional</em> implementation through harmonised RDF syntax bindings. Conversion rules to RDF syntax would allow Member States to maintain their collections of INSPIRE-relevant datasets following the INSPIRE Metadata technical guidelines based on [[ISO-19115]] and [[ISO-19119]], while at the same time publishing these collections on [[DCAT-AP]]-conformant data portals. A conversion to an RDF representation allows additional metadata elements to be displayed on general-purposed data portals, provided that such data portals are capable of displaying additional metadata elements. Additionally, data portals may be capable of providing machine-to-machine interfaces where additional metadata could be provided.</p>

<section id="context">

<h3>Context</h3>

<aside class="ednote">
<p>To be revised - especially the 2nd paragraph, which is citing references dating back to 2011, and nothing of what happened after that - one for all, the Open Data Directive.</p>
</aside>

<p>This document has been prepared in the context of Action 1.1 – Improving semantic interoperability in European eGovernment systems [[SEMIC]] of the European Commission’s Interoperability solutions for public administrations, businesses and citizens (ISA²) programme [[ISA2]].</p> 
<p>Studies conducted on behalf of the European Commission [[Vickery]] show that businesses and citizens still face difficulties in finding and re-using public sector information. In its communication on Open Data [[EC-OD-COM]] of 12 December 2011, the European Commission states that the availability of the information in a machine-readable format as well as a thin layer of commonly agreed metadata could facilitate data cross-reference and interoperability and therefore considerably enhance its value for reuse.</p> 
<p>Much of the public sector information that would benefit from interoperability is published as datasets in data portals. Therefore, an agreement on a common format for data exchange would support the sharing, discovery and re-use of this data.</p> 
<p>This document is the result of the major semantic change release process described in the Change and Release Management Policy for DCAT-AP [[DCAT-AP-CRMP]] and was built starting from GeoDCAT-AP version 1.0.1 [[GeoDCAT-AP-20160802]], with the purpose of aligning it with DCAT-AP version 2.0.1 [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] and with version 2.0.1 of the <abbr title="Infrastructure for spatial information in Europe">INSPIRE</abbr> Metadata Technical Guidelines [[INSPIRE-MD-20170302]].</p> 

</section>

<section id="scope-of-the-revision">

<h3>Scope of the revision</h3>

<aside class="ednote">
<p>To be revised</p>
</aside>

<p>The objective of this work is to produce an updated release of GeoDCAT-AP based on requests for change coming from real-world implementations of the specification and an alignment with [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] and [[INSPIRE-MD-20170302]].</p> 
<p>As [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], the Application Profile specified in this document is based on the specification of the <strong>Data Catalog Vocabulary</strong> (DCAT), originally  developed under the responsibility of the Government Linked Data Working Group [[GLD]] at W3C, and significantly revised in 2020 by the W3C Dataset Exchange Working Group [[DXWG]]. DCAT is an RDF [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]] vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogues published on the Web. Additional classes and properties from other well-known vocabularies are re-used where necessary.</p> 
<p>The work does not cover implementation issues like mechanisms for exchange of data and expected behaviour of systems implementing the Application Profile other than what is defined in the Conformance Statement in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#conformance"></a>.</p> 
<p>The Application Profile is intended to facilitate data exchange and therefore the classes and properties defined in this document are only relevant for the data to be exchanged; there are no requirements for communicating systems to implement specific technical environments. The only requirement is that the systems can export and import data in RDF in conformance with this Application Profile.</p> 

</section>

<section id="specification">

<h3>A DCAT-AP extension</h3>

<aside class="ednote">
<p>To be revised: adjust to official release of DCAT-AP. Plus propagate this through the text.</p>
</aside>

<!--
<p>The DCAT-AP Application Profile defined in this document is based on the specification of the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) of 16 January 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]], and the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) - Version 2, W3C Candidate Recommendation 03 October 2019 [[VOCAB-DCAT-2-20191003]].</p>
-->
<p>The GeoDCAT-AP specification is designed as an extension of DCAT-AP in conformance with the guidelines for the creation of DCAT-AP extensions [[DCAT-AP-EG]]. The DCAT-AP Application Profile on which this document is based is the DCAT-AP specification of 8 June 2020 [[DCAT-AP-20200608]].  According to the same principles DCAT-AP is in itself an extension of DCAT.</p>
<p>This dependency must be taken into account while reading and using this specification. When implementing GeoDCAT-AP, these specifications should be consulted first, to fill in any missing gaps in this document.</p> 

</section>

</section>

<section id="terminology">

<h2>Terminology used in the Application Profile</h2>
<aside class="ednote">
<p>This section has been copied from DCAT-AP. It covers 2 aspects, a) (a partial set of) definitions of the domain specific core concepts and b) an reading guide on specification terminology.</p>
<p>The proposal is to remove the definitions of the domain specific terminology and leave that to the appropriate places below.</p>
</aside>

<aside class="ednote">
<p>It is missing a definition for "Resource" - the superclass of all resources documented in a catalogue.</p>
<p>A possible definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>Resource</strong> is a dataset, data service, or any other kind of resource documented in a catalogue.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>

<p>An <strong>Application Profile</strong> is a specification that re-uses terms from one or more base standards, adding more specificity by identifying mandatory, recommended and optional elements to be used for a particular application, as well as recommendations for controlled vocabularies to be used.</p>

<p>A <strong>Dataset</strong> is a collection of data, published or curated by a single source, and available for access or download in one or more formats.</p>

<p>A <strong>Data Service</strong> is a Web-based system that gives access to or supports operations on one or more datasets via an interface (<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>).</p>

<p>A <strong>Data Portal</strong> is a Web-based system that contains a data catalogue with descriptions of datasets and provides services enabling discovery and re-use of the datasets.</p>

<aside class="ednote">
<p>The definitions of recommended classes and properties are inconsistent.</p>
<!--
<p>Moreover, a definition for deprecated properties and classes is missing.</p>
<p>A possible definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deprecated class</strong>: a receiver SHOULD be able to process information about instances of that class; a sender SHOULD NOT provide information about instances of that class.</li>
<li><strong>Deprecated property</strong>: a receiver SHOULD be able to process information about instances of that property; a sender SHOULD NOT provide the information about instances of that propertry.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
-->
</aside>

<p>In the following sections, classes and properties are grouped under headings ‘mandatory’, ‘recommended’ and ‘optional’. These terms have the following meaning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mandatory class</strong>: a receiver of data MUST be able to process information about instances of the class; a sender of data MUST provide information about instances of the class.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended class</strong>: a sender of data SHOULD provide information about instances of the class; a sender of data MUST provide information about instances of the class, if such information is available; a receiver of data MUST be able to process information about instances of the class.</li>
<li><strong>Optional class</strong>: a receiver MUST be able to process information about instances of the class; a sender MAY provide the information but is not obliged to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Mandatory property</strong>: a receiver MUST be able to process the information for that property; a sender MUST provide the information for that property.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended property</strong>: a receiver MUST be able to process the information for that property; a sender SHOULD provide the information for that property if it is available.</li>
<li><strong>Optional property</strong>: a receiver MUST be able to process the information for that property; a sender MAY provide the information for that property but is not obliged to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Deprecated class</strong>: a receiver SHOULD be able to process information about instances of that class; a sender SHOULD NOT provide information about instances of that class.</li>
<li><strong>Deprecated property</strong>: a receiver SHOULD be able to process information about instances of that property; a sender SHOULD NOT provide the information about instances of that propertry.</li>
</ul>

<p>The meaning of the terms MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD and MAY in this section and in the following sections are as defined in [[RFC2119]].</p>

<p>In the given context, the term "processing" means that receivers must accept incoming data and transparently provide these data to applications and services. It does neither imply nor prescribe what applications and services finally do with the data (parse, convert, store, make searchable, display to users, etc.).</p>

<p>Classes are classified as ‘Mandatory’ in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#mandatory-classes"></a> if they appear as the range of one of the mandatory properties in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#properties"></a>.</p>

<p>The class ‘Distribution’ is classified as ‘Recommended’ in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#recommended-classes"></a> to allow for cases that a particular Dataset does not have a downloadable Distribution, and in such cases the sender of data would not be able to provide this information. However, it can be expected that in the majority of cases Datasets do have downloadable Distributions, and in such cases the provision of information on the Distribution is mandatory.</p>

<p>All other classes are classified as ‘Optional’ in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#optional-classes"></a>. A further description of the optional classes is only included as a sub-section in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#properties"></a> if the Application Profile specifies mandatory or recommended properties for them.</p>
<!--
<aside class="ednote">
<p>It is missing a paragraph for deprecated classes.</p>
<p>E.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Classes no longer included in this version of the specification, or replaced with other ones, are classified as ‘Deprecated’ in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#deprecated-classes"></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
-->
<p>Classes no longer included in this version of the specification, or replaced with other ones, are classified as ‘Deprecated’ in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#deprecated-classes"></a>.</p>

<p>Finally, classes and properties added in this Application Profile and extending [[DCAT-AP]] are marked with a prepended &ldquo;plus&rdquo; sign (+), and summarised in the reference table in <a class="no-secRef" href="#geodcat-ap-classes-and-properties"></a>.</p>

<section id="namespaces">

<h3>Namespaces</h3>

</section>

<section id="overview">

<h3>Application Profile Overview</h3>

<p>This Application Profile extends [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] by including</p>
<ul>
<li>additional classes and properties (marked with a prepended &ldquo;plus&rdquo; sign (+) in this document, and summarised in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#geodcat-ap-classes-and-properties"></a>);</li>
<li>additional recommendations on the use of classes and properties (documented in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#classes"></a> and <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#properties"></a>);</li>
<li>additional controlled vocabularies (documented in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#controlled-vocabularies-to-be-used"></a>, along with the ones used in [[DCAT-AP-20200608]]).</li>
</ul>

<p>These extensions are meant to provide a DCAT-AP-conformant representation of geospatial metadata, identified by defining RDF syntax mappings covering the union of the elements in the INSPIRE metadata schema [[INSPIRE-MD-REG]] [[INSPIRE-MD]] and the core profile of [[ISO-19115]], following the criteria illustrated in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#inspire-and-iso-19115-mappings"></a>.</p>

<p>The current specification does not change the set of geospatial metadata elements already covered in its previous version [[GeoDCAT-AP-20160802]], but rather it updates some of the corresponding mappings based on the new classes and properties included in [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], following the release of version 2 of the W3C Data Catalog (DCAT) Vocabulary [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]], and aligns them with version 2.0.1 of the INSPIRE Metadata Technical Guidelines [[INSPIRE-MD-20170302]]. As a result, some of the classes and properties defined in [[GeoDCAT-AP-20160802]] have been deprecated and replaced by the equivalent ones in [[DCAT-AP-20200608]].</p>
<p>The list of deprecated classes and properties is summarised in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#deprecated-classes-and-properties"></a>.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-geodcat-ap-uml-class-diagram"></a> shows a UML diagram of all classes and properties included in the Application Profile.</p>

<h2>Application Profile Properties per Class</h2>

<aside class="ednote">
<p>To be revised.</p>
<p>Classes have been listed as in [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], followed by those classes added by GeoDCAT-AP, so to preserve the section numbering.</p>
<p>The current listing is not optimal, as the criteria behind the order in which classes are listed is unclear. Moreover, in each section there is no indication of whether a class is mandatory, recommended, or optional, and so readers need to go back to <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#classes"></a> to check this.</p>
<p>An option would be to group classes into specific sections - mandatory classes, recommended classes, optional classes - and to list them in alphabetical order, as done in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#classes"></a>.</p>

<p>A quick reference table of properties per class is included in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#quick-reference-of-classes-and-properties"></a>. The list of included properties contains all the properties in [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], plus a selection of properties from [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] and [[DCTERMS]], on which GeoDCAT-AP expresses additional constraints or on which GeoDCAT-AP wants to emphasise their usage.
<!--
A property which is not mentioned but would be applicable for a class according to [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] is considered out of scope for GeoDCAT-AP.

<h3>Requirements for controlled vocabularies</h3>

<p>The following is a list of requirements that were identified for the controlled vocabularies to be recommended in this Application Profile.</p>
<p>Controlled vocabularies SHOULD:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be published under an open licence.</li>
<li>Be operated and/or maintained by an institution of the European Union, by a recognised standards organisation or another trusted organisation.</li>
<li>Be properly documented.</li>
<li>Have labels in multiple languages, ideally in all official languages of the European Union.</li>
<li>Contain a relatively small number of terms (e.g. 10-25) that are general enough to enable a wide range of resources to be classified.</li>
<li>Have terms that are identified by URIs with each URI resolving to documentation about the term.</li>
<li>Have associated persistence and versioning policies.</li>
</ul>
<p>These criteria do not intend to define a set of requirements for controlled vocabularies in general; they are only intended to be used for the selection of the controlled vocabularies that are proposed for this Application Profile.</p>

<h3>Controlled vocabularies to be used</h3>
<!--
<aside class="ednote">
<p>To be revised to include those used by GeoDCAT-AP</p>
</aside>
-->
<p>In the table below, a number of properties are listed with controlled vocabularies that MUST be used for the listed properties. The declaration of the following controlled vocabularies as mandatory ensures a minimum level of interoperability.</p>

<p>Compared with [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], GeoDCAT-AP makes use of additional controlled vocabularies mandated by [[INSPIRE-MD-REG]], and operated by the INSPIRE Registry - with the only exceptions of the coordinate reference systems register maintained by OGC [[OGC-EPSG]].</p>
<p>For two of these controlled vocabularies, namely the INSPIRE spatial data themes [[INSPIRE-THEMES]] and the ISO topic categories [[INSPIRE-TC]], the GeoDCAT-AP Working Group has defined a set of harmonised mappings to the EU Vocabularies Data Themes [[EUV-THEMES]], in order to facilitate the identification of the relevant theme in [[EUV-THEMES]] for geospatial metadata. The status of this work, along with links to a machine readable representation of the mappings, is documented on a dedicated page in Joinup [[?GeoDCAT-ACV]].</p>

<h3>Other controlled vocabularies</h3>

<p>In addition to the proposed common vocabularies in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#controlled-vocabularies-to-be-used"></a>, which are mandatory to ensure minimal interoperability, implementers are encouraged to publish and to use further region or domain-specific vocabularies that are available online. While those may not be recognised by general implementations of the Application Profile, they may serve to increase interoperability across applications in the same region or domain. Examples are the full set of concepts in EuroVoc [[?EUV-EUROVOC]], the CERIF standard vocabularies [[?CERIF-VOCS]], the Dewey Decimal Classification [[?DDC]] and numerous other schemes.</p>

<p>For geospatial metadata, the working group has identified the following additional vocabularies:</p>

<!-- Agent roles -->

<section id="agent-roles" class="informative">

<h2>Agent Roles</h2>
<!--
<aside class="ednote">
<p>To be revised</p>
</aside>
-->
<p>GeoDCAT-AP supports the 11 agent roles defined in [[INSPIRE-MD-REG]] and [[ISO-19115]] by using two different but not mutually exclusive approaches. The first approach makes use of the relevant properties from [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] and [[DCTERMS]], which overall cover 4 of the relevant roles - namely, <code>dcat:contactPoint</code>, <code>dct:creator</code>, <code>dct:publisher</code>, and <code>dct:rightsHolder</code>. The second and more general approach is based on [[PROV-O]], where agent roles are specified via a &ldquo;qualified attribution&rdquo; (<code>prov:qualifiedAttribution</code>). More precisely, the relevant Agent is specified via property <code>prov:agent</code>, whereas the role is specified with property <code>dcat:hasRole</code>, which takes as value one of the responsible party roles defined in [[INSPIRE-MD-REG]] and [[ISO-19115]], and included in the relevant code list operated by the INSPIRE Registry [[INSPIRE-RPR]]. This pattern is illustrated in <a href="#ex-attribution"></a>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that, following [[INSPIRE-MD-REG]] and [[ISO-19115]], in GeoDCAT-AP all these agent roles can be specified on Catalogues, Catalogue Records, Datasets, and Data Services.</p>
<p>More details on these solutions are available in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#responsible-party-and-metadata-point-of-contact---dataset-responsible-party-and-metadata-point-of-contact"></a>.</p>
<!--
<p>The DCAT Application Profile specified in this document has a single property to relate an Agent (typically, an organisation) to a Dataset. The only such ‘agent role’ that can be expressed in the current version of the profile is through the property <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/publisher"><code>dct:publisher</code></a>, defined as “An entity responsible for making the dataset available”. A second property is available in the DCAT recommendation, <a data-cite="VOCAB-DCAT-20140116#Property:dataset_contactPoint"><code>dcat:contactPoint</code></a>, defined as “Link a dataset to relevant contact information which is provided using VCard”, but this is not an agent role as the value of this property is contact data, rather than a representation of the organisation as such.</p>
<p>In specific cases, for example in exchanging data among domain-specific portals, it may be useful to express other, more specific agent roles. In such cases, extensions to the base profile may be defined using additional properties with more specific meanings.</p>
<p>Two possible approaches have been discussed, particular in the context of the development of the domain-specific GeoDCAT Application Profile [[GeoDCAT-AP]], an extension of the base DCAT Application Profile. </p>
<p>The first possible approach is based on the use of a predicate vocabulary that provides a set of properties that represent additional types of relationships between Datasets and Agents. For example, properties could be defined, such as <code>foo:owner</code>, <code>foo:curator</code> or <code>foo:responsibleParty</code>, in addition to the use of existing well-known properties, such as <code>dct:creator</code> and <code>dct:rightsHolder</code>. A possible source for such additional properties is the Roles Named Authority List [[EUV-ROLES]] maintained by the Publications Office of the EU. Other domain-specific sources for additional properties are the INSPIRE Responsible Party roles [[INSPIRE-RPR]], the Library of Congress’ MARC relators [[MARC-REL]] and DataCite’s contributor types [[DataCite-Types]]. To enable the use of such properties, they must be defined as RDF properties with URIs in a well-managed namespace.</p>
<p>A second approach is based on the use of W3C’s PROV ontology [[PROV-O]] which provides a powerful mechanism to express a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent and interchange provenance information generated in different systems and under different contexts. In the context of work on GeoDCAT-AP, a PROV-conformant solution for expressing agent roles was agreed [[GeoDCAT-AP-RPR]]. This solution uses <code>prov:qualifiedAttribution</code> in combination with a <code>dct:type</code> assertion pointing to the code list for Responsible Party Role in the INSPIRE registry. To enable the use of such types, they must be defined with URIs in a well-managed namespace. </p>
<p>Based on the experience gained with the use of domain-specific extensions for additional ‘agent roles’ in the exchange of information about Datasets and on the requests of implementors and stakeholders, the  DCAT Application Profile release 2.0.0 is  extended with additional roles as proposed by DCAT Version 2, W3C Working Draft 28 May 2019 [[VOCAB-DCAT-2-20190528]] that have proven to be useful across domains. Precisely, properties <code>dct:creator</code>, <code>prov:qualifiedAttribution</code> and <code>prov:qualifiedRelation</code> have been added to <code>dcat:Dataset</code> class to further facilitate relationships between datasets and agents [[VOCAB-DCAT-QA]].</p>
<p>It should be noted that, even if a more expressive approach is used in a particular implementation, the provision of information using <code>dct:publisher</code> for the Catalogue is still mandatory under the rules laid down in the Conformance Statement in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#conformance"></a>, while the provision of information using <code>dct:publisher</code> is strongly recommended for Dataset. The provision of such information using <code>dct:publisher</code> will ensure interoperability with implementations that use the basic approach of DCAT-AP.</p>

<!-- Conformance Test Results -->

<section id="conformance-test-results" class="informative">

<h2>Conformance Test Results</h2>
<!--
<aside class="ednote">
<p>TBD</p>
</aside>
-->
<p>Following [[INSPIRE-MD-REG]] and [[ISO-19115]], GeoDCAT-AP supports the specification of test results to assess the degree of conformity of a resource (i.e., a Catalogue, a Dataset, a Data Service) with a given specification (e.g., a standard, a set of implementing rules, a set of data quality or interoperability criteria).</p>
<p>For this purpose, GeoDCAT-AP makes use of two different but not mutually exclusive approaches. More precisely, property <code>dct:conformsTo</code> is used when the test result states that a resource is conformant with a given specification. The more general approach is based on [[PROV-O]], and it specifies conformance test results as a testing activity (<code>prov:Activity</code>) that generates a result (specified with property <code>prov:generated</code>), corresponding to one of the degrees of conformity defined in [[INSPIRE-MD-REG]], and available from the INSPIRE Registry [[INSPIRE-DoC]]. The specification against which the testing activity is carried out is specified via a &ldquo;qualified association&rdquo; (<code>prov:qualifiedAssociation</code>), linked to a &ldquo;plan&rdquo; (<code>prov:hadPlan</code>) derived from (<code>prov:wasDerivedFrom</code>) the specification itself.</p> 
<p>This pattern is illustrated in <a href="#ex-activity"></a>.</p>

<!-- Accessibility and Multilingual Aspects --> 

<section id="accessibility-and-multilingual-aspects" class="informative">

<h2>Accessibility and Multilingual Aspects</h2>

<p><strong>Accessibility</strong> in the context of this Application Profile is limited to information about the technical format of distributions of datasets. The properties <code>dcat:mediaType</code> and <code>dct:format</code> provide information that can be used to determine what software can be deployed to process the data. The accessibility of the data within the datasets needs to be taken care of by the software that processes the data and is outside of the scope of this Application Profile.</p>
<p><strong>Multilingual aspects</strong> related to this Application Profile concern all properties whose contents are expressed as strings (i.e. <code>rdfs:Literal</code>) with human-readable text. Wherever such properties are used, the string values are of one of two types:</p>
<ul>
<li>The string is free text. Examples are descriptions and labels. Such text may be translated into several languages.</li>
<li>The string is an appellation of a ‘named entity’. Examples are names of organisations or persons. These names may have parallel versions in other languages but those versions don’t need to be literal translations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wherever values of properties are expressed with either type of string, the property can be repeated with translations in the case of free text and with parallel versions in case of named entities. For free text, e.g. in the cases of titles, descriptions and keywords, the <strong>language tag</strong> is mandatory. </p>
<p>Language tags to be used with <code>rdfs:Literal</code> are defined by [[BCP47]], which allows the use of the "t" extension for text transformations defined in [[RFC6497]] with the field "t0" [[CLDR]] indicating a machine translation.</p>
<p>A language tag will look like: "en-t-es-t0-abcd", which conveys the information that the string is in English, translated from Spanish by machine translation using a tool named "abcd".</p>
<p>For named entities, the language tag is optional and should only be provided if the parallel version of the name is strictly associated with a particular language. For example, the name ‘European Union’ has parallel versions in all official languages of the union, while a name like ‘W3C’ is not associated with a particular language and has no parallel versions.</p>
<p>For linking to different language versions of associated web pages (e.g. landing pages) or documentation, a content negotiation [[CONNEG]] mechanism may be used whereby different content is served based on the Accept-Languages indicated by the browser. Using such a mechanism, the link to the page or document can resolve to different language versions of the page or document.</p>
<p>All the occurrences of the property <code>dct:language</code>, which can be repeated if the metadata is provided in multiple languages, must have a URI as their object, not a literal string from the [[ISO-639]] code list.</p>
<p>How multilingual information is handled in systems, for example in indexing and user interfaces, is outside of the scope of this Application Profile.</p>

<h2>Privacy and security considerations </h2>

<p>The GeoDCAT-AP vocabulary supports the attribution of data and metadata to various participants such as resource creators, publishers and other parties or agents, and as such defines terms that may be related to personal information. In addition, it also supports the association of rights and licenses with cataloged Resources and Distributions. These rights and licenses could potentially include or reference sensitive information such as user and asset identifiers as <a data-cite="VOCAB-ODRL#privacy-consideration">described</a> in [[VOCAB-ODRL]].</p>
<p>Implementations that produce, maintain, publish or consume such vocabulary terms must take steps to ensure security and privacy considerations are addressed at the application level.</p>
