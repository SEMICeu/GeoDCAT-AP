<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>The objective of this work is to define an <em>RDF syntax</em> that can be used for the exchange of descriptions of <em>spatial</em> datasets, dataset series, and services among data portals. The RDF syntax should extend the DCAT Application Profile for data portals in Europe [[DCAT-AP]].</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To provide an RDF syntax binding for the <em>union</em> of the elements in the INSPIRE metadata schema [[INSPIRE-MD-REG]], [[INSPIRE-MD]] and the core profile of ISO 19115:2003 [[ISO-19115]]. The guiding design principle is to make the resulting RDF syntax as simple as possible; thereby maximally using existing RDF vocabularies – such as the Dublin Core [[DCTERMS]] and [[DCAT-AP]] –, and as much as possible avoiding minting new terms. The defined syntax binding must enable the conversion of metadata records <em>from</em> ISO 19115 / INSPIRE <em>to</em> a harmonised RDF representation. The ability to convert metadata records from RDF to ISO 19115 / INSPIRE is not a requirement.</p></li>
<!--
<li><p>To formulate recommendations to the Working Group dealing with the revision of the [[DCAT-AP]], to maximally align [[DCAT-AP]] and GeoDCAT-AP.</p></li>
-->
<li><p>To update the reference XSLT implementation [[GeoDCAT-XSLT]] of the mappings defined in the GeoDCAT-AP specification.</p></li>
<li><p>To take into account and refer to alignment of relevant controlled vocabularies (e.g., the alignments between GEMET, INSPIRE themes, EuroVoc carried out by the Publications Office of the EU [[EUV-EUROVOC]]).</p></li>
<!--<a href="http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/eurovoc/">http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/eurovoc/</a>).</p></li>-->
<!--<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>)</p></li>-->
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the following outcomes may be achieved, outside the context of this specification:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To define new controlled vocabularies or define mappings between controlled vocabularies.</p></li>
<!--
<li><p>To design executable transformation rules (i.e., an XSLT script [[GeoDCAT-XSLT]]), as a reference implementation of the mappings defined in the GeoDCAT-AP specification.</p></li>
-->
<li><p>To define an RDF syntax binding for the elements in ISO 19115-1:2014 [[?ISO-19115-1]].</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="motivation-and-use-cases" class="informative">

<h1>Motivation and use cases</h1>

<p>The basic use case that GeoDCAT-AP intends to enable is a cross-domain data portal search for datasets, as documented in the DCAT-AP specification, version 2.0.1 [[DCAT-AP-20200608]]. GeoDCAT-AP will make it easier to share descriptions of spatial datasets between spatial data portals and general data portals, and thus help increase public and cross-sector access to such high value datasets. The datasets could include:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Datasets on the INSPIRE Geoportal</dt>
<dd><p>The <a href="http://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/">INSPIRE Geoportal</a> aggregates metadata for over 100k datasets across Europe. It provides the means to search for spatial data sets and spatial data services, and subject to access restrictions, to view spatial data sets from the EU Member States within the framework of the INSPIRE Directive. The metadata stored on this portal is structured according to the INSPIRE Metadata Technical Guidelines, version 2.0.1 [[INSPIRE-MD-20170302]]. In order to maximise visibility and re-use, spatial datasets could also be listed on general-purpose Open Data Portals, such as the <a href="http://data.europa.eu/euodp/">European Union Open Data Portal</a> (EU ODP) and the <a href="http://data.europa.eu/europeandataportal/">European Data Portal</a> (EDP).</p></dd>
<dt>Datasets on national <abbr title="Spatial Data Infrastructures">SDIs</abbr></dt>
<dd><p>GeoDCAT-AP would facilitate the integration of SDIs operated by EU Member States with any data catalogue able to consume [[DCAT-AP]]-compliant metadata.</p></dd>
<dt>General geospatial datasets</dt>
<dd><p>The geospatial community shares a common background and makes consistent use of consolidated standards and technologies. In particular, as far as metadata are concerned, it is widespread to use standards like [[ISO-19115]] / [[ISO-19139]], for the representation and encoding of metadata, and OGC’s [[?CSW]] (Catalog Service for the Web) for accessing and querying metadata records. These standards are also those currently recommended in INSPIRE.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>An additional RDF syntax for INSPIRE and ISO 19115 metadata elements is beneficial, especially when other data portals support the [[DCAT-AP]] metadata elements only.</p>
<p>Conversion rules to RDF syntax would allow Member States to maintain their collections of INSPIRE-relevant datasets following the INSPIRE Metadata Technical Guidelines [[INSPIRE-MD]], while at the same time publishing these collections on [[DCAT-AP]]-conformant data portals. A conversion to RDF syntax – using for example the GeoDCAT-AP XSLT script [[GeoDCAT-XSLT]] - allows additional metadata elements to be displayed on general-purposed data portals, provided that such data portals are capable of displaying additional metadata elements. Furthermore, data portals frequently are complemented by a triple store, making that the full set of GeoDCAT-AP metadata can be queried through a SPARQL endpoint.</p>

<section id="methodology-and-summary-of-results" class="informative">

<h1>Methodology and summary of results</h1>

<p>Methodologically, the development of GeoDCAT-AP implies three main interrelated tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Definition of alignment criteria and requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Identification of the metadata elements to be covered by GeoDCAT-AP.</p></li>
<li><p>Definition of alignments for the metadata elements to be covered by GeoDCAT-AP.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These tasks and their results are described in the following sections.</p>

<section id="alignment-criteria-and-requirements">

<h2>Alignment criteria and requirements</h2>

<p>The overall objective of GeoDCAT-AP is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Provide a [[DCAT-AP]]-conformant representation of geospatial metadata.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide an as much as possible comprehensive RDF-based representation of geospatial metadata, based on widely used vocabularies, trying, at the same time, to avoid semantic loss and to promote cross-domain re-use.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure backward compatibiliy with previous versions of GeoDCAT-AP.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first two goals, having a different scope and applying to different use cases (see <a href="#motivation-and-use-cases"></a>), are reflected in the two mapping profiles of GeoDCAT-AP, core and extended, described in <a href="#rdf-syntax-bindings-for-inspire-and-iso19115-metadata-elements"></a>.</p>
<p>Note that point (1) implies that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>GeoDCAT-AP must include, at least, all the mandatory [[DCAT-AP]] elements.</p></li>
<li><p>Vocabularies different from [[DCAT-AP]] can be used only for those geospatial metadata elements not supported in [[DCAT-AP]].</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Another key criterion was to base as much as possible the defined alignments on existing practices, in particular those contributed by the GeoDCAT-AP WG. The objective was to build upon experiences having already addressed issues in scope of GeoDCAT-AP, and to avoid a negative impact on existing implementations.</p>
<p>Finally, as already mentioned in <a href="#objectives"></a>, whenever no suitable candidates were available in existing vocabularies to represent geospatial metadata elements, the possibility of defining new terms was not excluded. However, this option needed to be carefully assessed, and discarded whenever it might have led to a specification that was conflicting with standards under preparation.
<!--
For example, this was the case of the work carried out by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/dwbp/">W3C Data on the Web Best Practices Working Group</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/">joint W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Working Group</a>.
-->
</p>
<p>As it will be explained in <a href="#alignments-defined-in-geodcat-ap"></a>, no new terms have been defined in the current version of GeoDCAT-AP.</p>

<section id="metadata-elements-to-be-covered-by-geodcat-ap">

<h2>Metadata elements to be covered by GeoDCAT-AP</h2>

<p>The general criterion used for this task was that GeoDCAT-AP would ideally cover <em>all</em> the metadata elements of the core profile of [[ISO-19115]] and those defined in INSPIRE, with the requirement that only <em>optional</em> elements MAY be excluded.</p>
<p>Based on this, the current version of GeoDCAT-AP covers the following set of metadata elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All the metadata elements in the core profile of [[ISO-19115]].</p></li>
<li><p>All the metadata elements defined in INSPIRE, with the exclusion of those not common to all the INSPIRE spatial data themes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More precisely, the supported INSPIRE metadata elements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The set of metadata elements defined in the INSPIRE Metadata Regulation [[?INSPIRE-MD-REG]].</p></li>
<li><p>The set of metadata elements defined in the INSPIRE Data and Services Regulation (Article 13: “Metadata required for Interoperability”) [[INSPIRE-SDSS-REG]]. These elements are also listed in Appendix C.3 to the INSPIRE Metadata Technical Guidelines (version 2.0.1) [[INSPIRE-MD-20170302]].</p></li>
<li><p>The set of metadata elements recommended as common to most of the INSPIRE spatial data themes in the INSPIRE Data Specifications Technical Guidelines, and listed in the first table included in Appendix C.7 to the INSPIRE Metadata Technical Guidelines (version 2.0.1) [[INSPIRE-MD-20170302]]. These elements are the following ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintenance information.</p></li>
<li><p>Conceptual and domain consistency (Data quality – Logical consistency).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The full list of metadata elements covered by the current version of GeoDCAT-AP is available in <a href="#overview-of-metadata-elements-covered-by-geodcat-ap"></a> to this document.</p>
<p>The metadata elements not supported in the current version of GeoDCAT-AP are those recommended only for <em>specific</em> INSPIRE spatial data themes in the INSPIRE Data Specifications Technical Guidelines, and listed in Appendix C.7 to the INSPIRE Metadata Technical Guidelines (version 2.0.1) [[INSPIRE-MD-20170302]].</p>
<p>These elements have been excluded in the current version of GeoDCAT-AP for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The priority was to support all those elements relevant to any dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>These elements are all optional.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Support to these metadata elements might be provided in future versions of GeoDCAT-AP.</p>

<section id="alignments-defined-in-geodcat-ap">

<h2>Alignments defined in GeoDCAT-AP</h2>

<p>The alignments defined in the current version of GeoDCAT-AP are the result of an iterative revision process of [[GeoDCAT-AP-20160802]], following the criteria illustrated in the previous sections and the review of the GeoDCAT-AP WG. Alignments for [[ISO-19115-1]] have not been defined. <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#comparison-between-inspire-and-iso19115-12014"></a> contains an overview of the most important changes with respect to [[ISO-19115]].</p>

<p>The work started with the review of [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]], and [[INSPIRE-MD-20170302]], with the purpose of identifying possible disalignments of the mappings defined in [[GeoDCAT-AP]], as well as possible gaps in [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] and [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]], which may require the use of different vocabularies or the definition of new classes and/or properties in the GeoDCAT-AP namespace. In all these cases, backward compatibility with [[GeoDCAT-AP-20160802]] has been taken into account when implementing revisions.</p>
<p>Finally, the GeoDCAT-AP WG has worked in close coordination with the DCAT-AP WG, in order to ensure mutual compliance of the proposed solutions.</p>
<!---
<p>The alignments defined in the current version of GeoDCAT-AP are the result of an iterative revision process, following the criteria illustrated in the previous sections and the review of the GeoDCAT-AP WG.</p>
<p>The work started with the review of the suite of specifications concerning the INSPIRE profile of [[DCAT-AP]] (INSPIRE+DCAT-AP) [[INSPIRE-DCAT]], and of the preliminary proposals concerning the metadata elements not covered by INSPIRE+DCAT-AP.</p>
<p>In two specific cases, feedback has been asked to relevant standardisation bodies, in order to validate the proposal made in GeoDCAT-AP. In particular, this concerned feedback provided by the W3C Provenance Working Group on the use of the W3C PROV ontology [[PROV-O]] to model responsible party roles and conformance results (data quality).</p>
<p>Finally, the GeoDCAT-AP WG has worked in close coordination with the DCAT-AP WG, in order to ensure mutual compliance of the proposed solutions.</p>
-->
<p>The results of this work, reflected in the current version of GeoDCAT-AP, can be summarised as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Backward compatibility with [[GeoDCAT-AP-20160802]] is ensured: The revised mappings have been deprecated, but maintained in the mapping rules implemented in [[GeoDCAT-XSLT]] along with the new one, in the extended mapping profile of GeoDCAT-AP, and their support has been included in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#conformance"></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Compliance with [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] is ensured: The geospatial metadata elements covered by the defined mappings include all those that in [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] are mandatory, plus a subset of those that are recommended and optional.</p></li>
<li><p>GeoDCAT-AP offers alignments for all the metadata elements illustrated in <a href="#metadata-elements-to-be-covered-by-geodcat-ap"></a>, by using existing vocabularies, and without defining new terms.</p></li>
</ul>

<aside class="ednote">
<p>To be considered the possibility of defining terms for specifying spatial resolution for cases not covered by <code>dcat:spatialResolutionInMeters</code>.</p>
</aside>

<p>The majority of the alignments defined in GeoDCAT-AP provide a complete representation of the corresponding geospatial metadata elements, but some metadata elements have open issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Partial mappings: For some metadata elements, only a partial mapping is available. This concerns data quality and maintenance information, for which only the mandatory components have been mapped (for more details, see <a href="#conformity-and-data-quality---not-in-iso19115-core"></a> and <a href="#maintenance-information---not-in-iso19115-core"></a>, respectively). This decision was taken because existing vocabularies did not offer the ability to represent all the components of these metadata elements.</p></li>
<li><p>Provisional mappings: For some metadata elements, no suitable candidate has been found to model them also partially. This concerns the following element:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>spatial resolution (see <a href="#spatial-resolution-spatial-resolution-of-the-dataset"></a>);</p></li>
<!--
<li><p>data quality and conformity (<a href="#conformity-and-data-quality---not-in-iso19115-core"></a>);</p></li>
<li><p>(coordinate and temporal) reference systems (<a href="#coordinate-reference-systems-and-temporal-reference-systems-reference-system"></a>).</p></li>
-->
</ul>
<p>The alignments for this element defined in the current version of GeoDCAT-AP must then be considered as unstable, and are meant to be replaced by appropriate terms defined in standard vocabularies (whether and when available).
<!--
Notably, both the W3C Data on the Web Best Practices WG and the joint W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Working Group planned to standardise the representation of data granularity (which includes spatial resolution), data quality and conformity, and reference systems.

<h2>Overview of bindings for GeoDCAT-AP Core</h2>

<p>This section provides an overview of <strong>GeoDCAT-AP Core</strong>. This includes bindings for metadata elements of the INSPIRE metadata and metadata elements in the core profile of [[ISO-19115]] core <em>for which DCAT-AP provides an RDF syntax binding</em>. Those metadata elements for which [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] does not provide a binding are part of the GeoDCAT-AP Extended mapping profile described in <a href="#overview-of-bindings-for-geodcat-ap-extended"></a>.</p>

<p>GeoDCAT-AP Core is meant to enable the harvesting and re-use of spatial metadata records through [[DCAT-AP-20200608]]-conformant applications and services, including data portals and APIs. The alignments for INSPIRE and [[ISO-19115]] metadata elements that are not included in GeoDCAT-AP Core are defined in GeoDCAT-AP Extended, see <a href="#overview-of-bindings-for-geodcat-ap-extended"></a>.</p>
<!--
<p>In addition to this, GeoDCAT-AP Core does not provide alignments from metadata records concerning services, with the only exception of catalogue or discovery services, which are the only ones supported in [[DCAT-AP-20200608]].</p>
-->
<p>In the following table, the starred elements (*) are used to indicate the corresponding metadata element in the core profile of [[ISO-19115]]. For each element, it is indicated whether the element is mandatory (<abbr title="mandatory">M</abbr>), optional (<abbr title="optional">O</abbr>), conditional (<abbr title="conditional">C</abbr>), or recommended (<abbr title="recommended">R</abbr>) in either specification.</p>

<h2>Overview of bindings for GeoDCAT-AP Extended</h2>

<p>This section provides an overview of the RDF syntax bindings in GeoDCAT-AP Extended. This GeoDCAT-AP mapping profile covers elements defined in INSPIRE and the core profile of [[ISO-19115]], for which [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] does not provide a syntax binding. GeoDCAT-AP Extended is a <em>superset</em> of GeoDCAT-AP Core.</p>
<p>The following table contains the defined RDF syntax binding for INSPIRE metadata. In the table below, the starred elements (*) are used to indicate the corresponding metadata element in the core profile of [[ISO-19115]]. For each metadata element, it is indicated whether the element is mandatory (M), optional (O), conditional (C), or recommended (R) in either specification.</p>
<p>Please note that some metadata elements have an RDF syntax binding in both the GeoDCAT-AP Core and Extended mapping profile. These elements fall in one of these categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Partial coverage by a [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] binding</strong>: This concerns conformity (only degree of conformity equal to &ldquo;conformant&rdquo; is supported) and responsible organisation (only responsible party roles creator, publisher, and point of contact are supported).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Subsumption by a GeoDCAT-AP RDF binding</strong>: ISO metadata elements available in GeoDCAT-AP Core, but for which only a many-to-one mapping is supported in [[DCAT-AP-20200608]]. This concerns resource types, since the [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] notion of dataset models both the ISO/INSPIRE notions of data set and data series.
<!--
; the [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] notion of data catalogue models only one of the types of spatial data services.
-->
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In order to preserve the original semantics, the extended mapping profile of GeoDCAT-AP defines additional alignments to those included in GeoDCAT-AP Core. The two sets of alignments are not mutually exclusive, and can coexist without creating conflicts.</p>

<h2>Resource type - *not in ISO 19115 core</h2>

<aside class="note">
<p>This mapping has been revised in this version of the GeoDCAT-AP specification.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class <code>dctype:Service</code> has been <a href="#service">deprecated</a>, and replaced by class <code>dcat:DataService</code> to denote services.</li>
<li>Mappings for services have been moved to the core mapping profile of GeoDCAT-AP, following their support in [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], with the exception of property <code>dct:type</code>.</li>
</ul>
</aside>

<p>In [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]], the notion of dataset is quite broad, and may include both the INSPIRE notions of <strong>dataset</strong> and <strong>dataset series</strong>. Moreover, currently no existing vocabulary provides suitable candidates for the INSPIRE notions of dataset series – the existing ones are very generic (e.g., <code>dctype:Collection</code> is defined as <q>An aggregation of resources</q> [[DCTERMS]]).</p>
<p>Based on this, in GeoDCAT-AP both INSPIRE datasets and dataset series are specified as instances of <code>dcat:Dataset</code>.</p>
<p>Moreover, in order to maintain the INSPIRE distinction between datasets and dataset series, following the work on aligning INSPIRE Metadata and Dublin Core [[?INSPIRE-DC]], in the extended mapping profile of GeoDCAT-AP they will be denoted by using the resource type code list operated by the INSPIRE Registry [[INSPIRE-RT]], and by using <code>dct:type</code>. More precisely, the following URIs SHOULD be used to denote, respectively, dataset and series:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/ResourceType/dataset">http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/ResourceType/dataset</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/ResourceType/series">http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/ResourceType/series</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>As far as the INSPIRE notion of <strong>service</strong> is concerned, [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] and [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] provide a specific class, namely, <code>dcat:DataService</code>, whereas class <code>dcat:Catalog</code> can be used to complement <code>dcat:DataService</code> for ‘discovery services’ in INSPIRE. Additionally, the spatial data service type can be specified by using <code>dct:type</code> with the corresponding code lists operated by the INSPIRE Registry [[INSPIRE-SDST]]. More precisely, the following URI SHOULD be used to denote services:</p>
<!--
<p>As far as the INSPIRE notion of <strong>service</strong> is concerned, [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] and [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] provide a single class, namely, <code>dcat:Catalog</code>, which only matches the notion of ‘discovery service’ in INSPIRE. Other services will be of type <code>dctype:Service</code>. Additionally, the spatial data service type can be specified by using <code>dct:type</code> with the corresponding code lists operated by the INSPIRE Registry. More precisely, the following URI SHOULD be used to denote services:</p>

<p>For the reason explained above, the core mapping profile of GeoDCAT-AP includes only the mappings for catalogue services (i.e., <code>dcat:Catalog</code>), whereas the mappings of other types of services are supported only in the extended mapping profile of GeoDCAT-AP.</p>

<h2>Resource language and metadata language - *Dataset language and Metadata language</h2>

<p>In INSPIRE metadata, metadata and resource languages (which may be different) are specified by using the three-letter language codes defined in [[?ISO-639-2]].</p>
<p>Based on [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], both elements are specified with property <code>dct:language</code>, with the URI of the relevant language available from the relevant register operated by the EU Publications Office [[EUV-LANG]].</p>
<p><a href="#ex-mapping-resource-language"></a> assumes that the metadata language is Dutch, and the resource language is German.</p>

<p>The metadata language can be also used to specify the language of textual elements of resource metadata by using the <code>@xml:lang</code> attribute [[XML]].</p>
<p>Since <code>@xml:lang</code> takes as value language identifiers defined by IETF BCP 47 [[BCP47]], a mapping from the actual value of the metadata language is needed.</p>

<section id="topic-category-originating-controlled-vocabulary-and-keyword-value---dataset-topic-category">

<h2>Topic category, originating controlled vocabulary, and keyword value - *Dataset topic category</h2>

<p>In INSPIRE, these two elements have specific purposes. Quoting from the INSPIRE Metadata Regulation [[?INSPIRE-MD-REG]] (§2.1 and §3.1, respectively):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The topic category is a high-level classification scheme to assist in the grouping and topic-based search of available spatial data resources.</p></li>
<li><p>The keyword value is a commonly used word, formalised word or phrase used to describe the subject. While the topic category is too coarse for detailed queries, keywords help narrowing a full text search and they allow for structured keyword search.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, two types of keywords are allowed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>free keywords;</p></li>
<li><p>keywords taken from a controlled vocabulary.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, topic categories apply only to datasets and dataset series.</p>

<section id="topic-category-and-keyword-in-datasets-and-dataset-series">

<h3>Topic category and keyword in datasets and dataset series</h3>

<p>As far as dataset metadata are concerned, in both [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] and [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], a distinction is made only between free keywords and keywords from controlled vocabularies, associated with a URI. For the former, <code>dcat:keyword</code> is used, whereas for the latter <code>dcat:theme</code> (which is a sub-property of <code>dct:subject</code>). Since the INSPIRE Registry operates URI registers for topic categories and INSPIRE spatial data themes, and in order to keep the distinction existing in INSPIRE between topic categories and keywords, the mapping is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Topic category is mapped to <code>dct:subject</code>, and expressed by the corresponding URIs minted for the ISO code list in the INSPIRE Registry – reference register:</p>
<p><a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/TopicCategory">http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/TopicCategory</a></p></li>
<li><p>Keywords not associated with a controlled vocabulary will be mapped to <code>dcat:keyword</code>;</p></li>
<li><p>INSPIRE spatial data themes are mapped to <code>dcat:theme</code> and expressed by the corresponding URI in the INSPIRE Registry – reference register:</p>
<p><a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/theme">http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/theme</a></p></li>
<li><p>Keywords associated with other controlled vocabularies are mapped to <code>dcat:theme</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Following [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] recommendations, keywords from controlled vocabularies SHOULD be preferably specified with dereferenceable HTTP URIs. In such a case, the information concerning the originating controlled vocabulary can be omitted.</p>
<p>When keywords cannot be specified with HTTP URIs, they SHOULD be modelled as a <code>skos:Concept</code> associated with a <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code> (modelling the originating controlled vocabulary), and annotated with the textual content and reference date(s) in the relevant INSPIRE metadata elements.</p>
<p>The representation of the information concerning the controlled vocabulary is illustrated in the following table.</p>

<table id="table-mapping-orginated-controlled-vocabulary" class="simple">

</tbody>
</table>

<p>For conformance with [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], GeoDCAT-AP records MUST also include keywords from the EU Vocabularies Data Theme Named Authority List [[EUV-THEMES]].</p>
<p>In order to ensure consistency, the relevant EU Vocabularies Data Theme keywords SHOULD be selected based on mappings with the controlled vocabularies used in INSPIRE / ISO 19115 metadata.</p>

<aside class="note">
<p>The GeoDCAT-AP WG has defined a set of harmonised mappings between the relevant vocabularies. The status of this work, and links to a machine readable representation of the mappings, is documented on a dedicated page in Joinup [[?GeoDCAT-ACV]].</p>

<h3>Keyword in services</h3>

<aside class="note">
<p>This mapping has been revised in this version of the GeoDCAT-AP specification.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Property <code>dc:subject</code> has been <a href="#data-service-subject-as-tag">deprecated</a>, and replaced by property <code>dcat:keyword</code> to specify free-text keywords for services.</li>
<li>Property <code>dct:subject</code> has been <a href="#data-service-subject">deprecated</a>, and replaced by property <code>dcat:theme</code> to specify keywords from controlled vocabularies for services.</li>
</ul>
</aside>

<p>As far as service metadata are concerned, keywords can classify either a service or the datasets / series operated by the service itself. For the latter, INSPIRE Metadata Regulation requires using at least one of the keywords from the ISO 19119 code list of spatial data service categories.</p>
<p>Both [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] and [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] do not have any specific property for keywords classifying either a service or the datasets / series operated by a service. Moreover, <code>dcat:theme</code> and <code>dcat:keyword</code> cannot be used for services, since their domain is restricted to <code>dcat:Dataset</code>.</p>
<!--
<div class="issue" data-number="8">
</div>
-->
<p>In order to keep the distinction between these two types of keywords, the adopted solution is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keywords from the ISO 19119 codelists of spatial data service type and categories are mapped to <code>dct:type</code>, and expressed by the corresponding URI in the INSPIRE Registry – reference registers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/SpatialDataServiceType">http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/SpatialDataServiceType</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/SpatialDataServiceCategory">http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/SpatialDataServiceCategory</a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Keywords not associated with a controlled vocabulary will be mapped to <code>dcat:keyword</code>, and represented as un-typed literals;</p></li>
<li><p>INSPIRE spatial data themes are mapped to <code>dcat:theme</code>, and expressed by the corresponding URI in the INSPIRE Registry – reference register:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/theme">http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/theme</a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Keywords associated with other controlled vocabularies are mapped to <code>dcat:theme</code>. If not denoted by an HTTP URI, they SHOULD be expressed as a <code>skos:Concept</code> associated with a <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code>, and annotated with the textual content and reference date(s) in the relevant INSPIRE metadata elements.</p></li>
<!--
<li><p>Keywords not associated with a controlled vocabulary will be mapped to <code>dc:subject</code>, and represented as un-typed literals;</p></li>

<h2>Geographic bounding box - *Geographic location of the dataset (by 4 coordinates or by geographic identifier)</h2>

<aside class="note">
<p>This mapping has been revised in this version of the GeoDCAT-AP specification.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Following [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] and [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], property <code>locn:geometry</code> has been complemented by two additional properties, namely, <code>dcat:bbox</code> and <code>dcat:centroid</code> to be used when the spatial coverage is specified as a bounding box or a centroid, respectively.</li>
</ul>
</aside>

<p>In the core profile of [[ISO-19115]], spatial coverage can be specified either with a bounding box (a geometry) or a geographic identifier. INSPIRE is more restrictive, in that it requires to use a bounding box</p>
<p>Based on that, GeoDCAT-AP specified spatial coverage as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Bounding box</dt>
<dd>
<p>As a general rule, when the area corresponding to the spatial coverage is denoted by a geometry, as in INSPIRE, [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] recommends the use of the Core Location Vocabulary [[LOCN]], where this is done by using property <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/locn#locn:geometry"><code>locn:geometry</code></a>, having as range a geometry specified as</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a URI - e.g., by using the geo URI scheme (IET RFC-5870) [[?RFC5870]], or a geohash URI [[?GEOHASH]], [[?GEOHASH-36]];</p></li>
<li><p>a syntax encoding scheme - e.g., geohashes [[?GEOHASH]], [[?GEOHASH-36]], WKT [[?ISO-19125-1]], GML [[?GML]], KML [[?KML]], GeoJSON [[?GEOJSON]]; or</p></li>
<li><p>a semantic representation - using vocabularies like W3C Lat/long [[?W3C-BASIC-GEO]] or schema.org [[?SCHEMA-ORG]].</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, in case the geometry is a bounding box or a centroid, properties <code>dcat:bbox</code> and <code>dcat:centroid</code>, respectively, SHOULD be used instead of <code>locn:geometry</code>.</p>

<!--
<aside class="note">
<p>Please note that the Core Location Vocabulary does not restrict <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/locn#locn:geometry"><code>locn:geometry</code></a> to bounding box geometries only.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that currently there is no agreement on a preferred format to be used in RDF for the representation of geometries. In GeoDCAT-AP, geometries can be provided in any, and possibly multiple, encodings, but at least one of the following must be made available: WKT or GML. An additional requirement concerns the coordinate reference system (CRS) used, which may vary on a country or territory basis. The CRS must be specified in the GML or WKT encoding as required by GeoSPARQL [[GeoSPARQL]]. Geometries shall be interpreted using the axis order defined in the spatial reference system used. For example, for <abbr title="WGS 84 longitude-latitude">CRS84</abbr> the axis order is longitude / latitude, whereas for <abbr title="World Geodetic System 1984">WGS84</abbr> the axis order is latitude / longitude. Summarising:</p>
<!--

-->
<ul>
<li><p>Geometries MAY be provided in multiple encodings, but at least one of the following MUST be made available: GML and WKT.</p></li>
<li><p>For GML and WKT, the CRS MUST be specified as defined in GeoSPARQL [[GeoSPARQL]].</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Geographic identifier</dt>
<dd>
<p>[[ISO-19115]] core also allows specifying the geographic location using a geographic identifier. Following [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], for this, it is RECOMMENDED to use an HTTP URI from one of the following registers / gazetteers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Named Authority Lists operated by the Metadata Registry of the EU Publications office concerning continents [[EUV-CONT]], countries [[EUV-COUNTRIES]], and places [[EUV-PLACES]].</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If none of the above provides the relevant geographic identifiers, Geonames [[?GEONAMES]] SHOULD be used.</p>
<p>If an HTTP URI is not available, the geographic identifier MUST be expressed with <code>skos:prefLabel</code>, and the reference to the originating controlled vocabulary (if any) MUST be specified with <code>skos:inScheme</code>. The controlled vocabulary will be described by a name (<code>dct:title</code>) and a last modified data (<code>dct:modified</code>).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As far as geographic identifiers are concerned, following [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], GeoDCAT-AP does not prevent the use other vocabularies in addition to the recommended ones. The vocabularies identified by the GeoDCAT-AP WG are listed in <a href="#controlled-vocabularies-to-be-used"></a>.</p>

<h2>Conformity and data quality - *not in ISO 19115 core</h2>

<p>In [[ISO-19115]], conformance and quality information is encoded as a quality report containing the result of a test (an evaluation) of a given quality measure, according to an evaluation method, with either a quantitative result (a metric) or a conformance result (pass or fail) as most important outcome.</p>
<p>The current version of GeoDCAT-AP only defines a syntax binding for conformity and not for data quality in general, making use of property <code>dct:conformsTo</code> and the W3C Provenance Ontology (PROV-O) [[PROV-O]] as explained in the following paragraphs. 
<!--
<p>For encoding conformance, GeoDCAT-AP uses <code>dct:conformsTo</code> and the W3C Provenance Ontology (PROV-O) [[PROV-O]] as explained in the following paragraphs. 
For encoding other aspects of data quality, GeoDCAT-AP does not provide a syntax binding as there is a risk that the (future) work of other standards bodies on data quality may make the defined syntax binding for GeoDCAT-AP outdated.
For example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/dwbp/">W3C Data on the Web Best Practices WG</a> is working on a Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) [[?VOCAB-DQV]].
To limit the impact, it was decided to only provide a partial mapping for Data Quality / Conformance.</p>

<p>[[DCAT-AP-20200608]] provides a single candidate, <code>dct:conformsTo</code>, which however can be used to map only a conformity of degree ‘conformant’. This is suitable for the core mapping profile of GeoDCAT-AP.</p>
<p>Considering how conformity must be expressed in extended mapping profile of GeoDCAT-AP (see [[INSPIRE-MD-REG]], Part B, §7), possible candidates are the W3C Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) [[?EARL10]] and the W3C Provenance Ontology (PROV-O) [[PROV-O]]. The latter candidate was chosen by the GeoDCAT-AP Working Group, since it would enable wider re-use with respect to the EARL vocabulary, which is more specific, and its use is limited.</p>
<p>[[PROV-O]] allows encoding conformity as a test activity (<code>prov:Activity</code>) that generated a result specified with property <code>prov:generated</code>, corresponding to the degree of conformity, for which the INSPIRE Registry maintains a URI set [[INSPIRE-DoC]]. The specification against which the conformance is asserted is specified via a qualified association (<code>prov:qualifiedAssociation</code>) with a test plan (a <code>prov:Plan</code>) in turn derived from a standard (<code>dct:Standard</code>, also <code>prov:Entity</code>). These associations are made via a property chain: <code>prov:qualifiedAssociation</code>, <code>prov:hadPlan</code>, and <code>prov:wasDerivedFrom</code>.</p>
<p>This pattern is illustrated in the following table.</p>

<p>In order to grant interoperability with [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], when conformity is of degree “conformant”, the proposal is to use both [[PROV-O]] and <code>dct:conformsTo</code> for GeoDCAT-AP Extended.</p>

<h2>Conditions for access and use and limitations on public access – Use limitation and access / other constraints</h2>

<aside class="note">
<p>This mapping has been revised in this version of the GeoDCAT-AP specification.</p>
<p>In particular, the mapping has been aligned with [[INSPIRE-MD-20170302]], which defined new encoding rules for use and access limitations.</p>
</aside>

<p>In [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], licensing information is specified on (a) data catalogues (services) and on (b) the distribution(s) of a dataset, and not on the dataset itself. The principle is that different dataset distributions may be associated with different licensing terms. Moreover, [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] recommends the use of <code>dct:accessRights</code> for specifying access conditions.</p>
<p>Based on this, GeoDCAT-AP specifies use and access limitations by using, respectively, <code>dct:license</code> and <code>dct:accessRights</code>. These properties take as value the URI of the use / access limitations, when available. Otherwise, since the range of these properties is not a literal, but, respectively, classes <code>dct:LicenseDocument</code> and <code>dct:RightsStatement</code>, the free-text content of the corresponding ISO 19115 / INSPIRE metadata elements can be expressed by using <code>rdfs:label</code>, as illustrated in [[?DC-UG-PM]].</p>

<aside class="note">
<p>It is worth noting that, for specifying use and access limitations, [[INSPIRE-MD-20170302]] recommends the use of the relevant URI sets operated by the INSPIRE Registry - namely, [[INSPIRE-CAU]], for two cases of use limitations (&ldquo;no conditions apply&rdquo; and &ldquo;conditions unknown&rdquo;), and [[INSPIRE-LPA]], for access limitations.</p>
<p>Moreover, [[INSPIRE-MD-20170302]] recommends against the use of free-text only for specifying access limitations. Because of this, access limitations SHOULD be specified only with URIs from [[INSPIRE-LPA]]. Property <code>rdfs:label</code> MAY only be used to specify access limitations in legacy metadata records, not compliant with [[INSPIRE-MD-20170302]].</p>
<!--
<p>It is a RECOMMENDED good practice to mint URIs for licence documents and right statements.</p>

<p>Based on this, these elements are provisionally mapped to property <code>dct:conformsTo</code>. Moreover, in order to indicate that the object of <code>dct:conformsTo</code> denotes a reference system, an additional statement with predicate <code>dct:type</code> is added, with a code list value defining the notion of (spatial / temporal) reference system, taken from the glossary operated by the INSPIRE Registry.</p>

<p>In GeoDCAT-AP, these elements are mapped to property <code>dct:conformsTo</code>. Moreover, in order to indicate that the object of <code>dct:conformsTo</code> denotes a reference system, an additional statement with predicate <code>dct:type</code> is added, with a code list value defining the notion of (spatial / temporal) reference system, taken from the glossary operated by the INSPIRE Registry.</p>
<p>More precisely, the following URIs SHOULD be used to denote, respectively, spatial and temporal reference systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/glossary/SpatialReferenceSystem">http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/glossary/SpatialReferenceSystem</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/glossary/TemporalReferenceSystem">http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/glossary/TemporalReferenceSystem</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The reference system identifier SHOULD be preferably represented with an HTTP URI. In particular, spatial reference systems should be specified by using the corresponding URIs from the “EPSG coordinate reference systems” register operated by the Open Geospatial Consortium [[OGC-EPSG]].</p>
<p>In this register, the URI prefix for coordinate reference systems is the following one:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/">http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/</a></p>
<p>followed by the number identifying the coordinate reference system in the EPSG register. For instance, the following URI</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4258">http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4258</a></p>
<p>identifies coordinate reference system EPSG 4258, corresponding to ETRS89 (European Terrestrial Reference System 1989).</p>

<aside class="note">
<p>It is important to note that [[OGC-EPSG]] currently does not support an RDF representation of spatial reference systems, but only an XML one. An XML-to-RDF mapping proposal, built upon and extending the GeoDCAT-AP approach, is maintained in [[?EPSG-RDF]].</p>
</aside>

<p>In case the reference system is not specified as an HTTP URI, the mapping covers also other information included in the source metadata - as the identifier (<code>dct:identifier</code>), name (<code>dct:title</code>), and version (<code>owl:versionInfo</code>), plus a reference to the relevant register, if available (<code>skos:inScheme</code>). If a reference register is available, the reference system is implicitly also a <code>skos:Concept</code>, and its name can be specified by using <code>skos:prefLabel</code>.</p>

<aside class="note">
<p>The GeoDCAT-AP approach for the specification of reference systems is also documented in [[SDW-BP]] (<a data-cite="?SDW-BP#bp-crs">Best Practice 8</a>, Example 22) and in [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] (<a data-cite="VOCAB-DCAT-2#ex-dataset-crs">Example 34</a>).</p>

<h2>Character encoding - *Dataset character set and *Metadata character set</h2>

<p>In [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] and [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], the specification of the character encoding of a dataset and the character encoding of a metadata record is not explicitly supported.</p>
<p>According to [[?RFC4288]], the character set can be part of the media type specification, but only for type “text”. By contrast, in INSPIRE the character set can be specified also for other media types.</p>
<p>The W3C Content vocabulary [[Content-in-RDF10]] provides a possibly suitable candidate, namely, property <code>cnt:characterEncoding</code>, taking as value the character set names in the IANA register [[IANA-CHARSETS]]. GeoDCAT-AP uses this property.</p>
<p>Character encoding in [[ISO-19115]] metadata is specified with a code list that can be mapped to the corresponding codes in [[IANA-CHARSETS]]

<h2>Encoding - *Distribution format</h2>

<p>In both [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] and [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], this information is specified for the distribution(s) of a dataset, and not for the dataset itself.</p>
<p>Two properties are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>dcat:mediaType</code>: to be used when the format corresponds to one of the media types registered by IANA [[IANA-MEDIA-TYPES]].</p></li>
<li><p><code>dct:format</code>: to be used in all the other cases, to be used with file type register operated by the Publications Office of the EU [[EUV-FT]].</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The same approach is used in GeoDCAT-AP for ISO 19115 / INSPIRE metadata.</p>
<!--
<p>In both cases, [[DCAT-AP-20200608]] recommends the use of the URI file type register [[EUV-FT]], operated by the Metadata Registry of the Publications Office of the EU, to specify formats/media types. However, this register does not include many of the formats/media types typically used for INSPIRE data – as, e.g., GML, shapefiles and raster files – which are available through the INSPIRE media type register [[INSPIRE-MT]].</p>
<p>The proposal is then to use the file type register of the Publications Office, if it includes the relevant format/media type, and the INSPIRE Media Types register otherwise.</p>

<h2>Spatial representation type – *Spatial representation type</h2>

<p>In [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], no equivalent term is provided.</p>
<p>In [[ISO-19115]], element “Spatial representation type” is meant mainly to describe the “method used to represent geographic information in the dataset”, by using a code list (see the table below).</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Asset Description Metadata Schema">ADMS</abbr> vocabulary [[VOCAB-ADMS]] includes a property, namely, <code>adms:representationTechnique</code> that could be used for this purpose. It is worth noting that, in the ADMS specification, <code>adms:representationTechnique</code> decribes a distribution, and not the dataset. Moreover, the [[ISO-19115]] code list of spatial representation types might be in the future available as a URI register from the INSPIRE Registry.</p>

<aside class="ednote">
<p>The relevant register has not been eventually created.</p>
<p>A possible option is to use the corresponding URIs from <a href="https://github.com/ISO-TC211/GOM/blob/master/isotc211_GOM_harmonizedOntology/iso19115/2003/IdentificationInformation.rdf">the relevant ISO 19115 ontology</a>, although they are not dereferenceable (as the ones currently used in GeoDCAT-AP) - namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>http://def.isotc211.org/iso19115/2003/IdentificationInformation/code/MD_SpatialRepresentationTypeCode/vector</code></li>
<li><code>http://def.isotc211.org/iso19115/2003/IdentificationInformation/code/MD_SpatialRepresentationTypeCode/grid</code></li>
<li><code>http://def.isotc211.org/iso19115/2003/IdentificationInformation/code/MD_SpatialRepresentationTypeCode/tin</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There is however some work in ISO to set up a linked data registry, so it may eventually provide dereferenceable URIs, although the URIs may not necessarily correspond to the ones above.</p>

<p>Based on this, GeoDCAT-AP models this information by using property <code>adms:representationTechnique</code>, with the spatial representation type URIs that will be operated by the INSPIRE Registry.</p>
<p>This mapping is supported only in the extended mapping profile of GeoDCAT-AP.</p>
<p>The spatial representation types defined in [[ISO-19115]] are listed in the following table. It is important to note that, as stated in the INSPIRE Data Specifications, the only spatial representation types in scope of INSPIRE are the following ones: “vector”, “grid”, and “tin”.</p>

<h2>Maintenance information - *not in ISO 19115 core</h2>

<p>In [[ISO-19115]], element “Maintenance information” is meant mainly to describe how frequently a resource is updated.</p>
<p>In [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], the update frequency is expressed through <code>dct:accrualPeriodicity</code>, with the frequency codes defined in the the EU Vocabularies Frequency Named Authority List [[EUV-FREQ]], which can be partially mapped to the ones used in [[ISO-19115]], as shown in the following table.</p>
<!--
<p>[[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] and [[DCAT-AP-20200608]], the update frequency is expressed through <code>dct:accrualPeriodicity</code>, with the frequency codes defined in the Dublin Core Collection Description Frequency Vocabulary [[?CLD-FREQ]], which can be partially mapped to the ones used in [[ISO-19115]], as shown in the following table (the missing alignments are in bold). A similar mapping was added for the EU Vocabularies Frequency Named Authority List [[EUV-FREQ]].</p>
-->
<p>The [[ISO-19115]] code list of maintenance frequency codes might be in the future available as a URI register from the INSPIRE Registry.</p>

<aside class="ednote">
<p>The relevant register has not been eventually created.</p>
</aside>

<p>Based on this, maintenance frequency is modelled in GeoDCAT-AP by using <code>dct:accrualPeriodicity</code> with the EU Vocabularies Frequency Named Authority List [[EUV-FREQ]].</p>
<p>For the frequency codes not covered by the EU Vocabularies Frequency code list, the approach will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the core mapping profile of GeoDCAT-AP these codes will be ignored.</p></li>
<li><p>The extended mapping profile of GeoDCAT-AP will use the code list of ISO maintenance frequency codes operated by the INSPIRE Registry.</p></li>
</ul>

<aside class="ednote">
<p>A possible option to address this disalignment is to submit a request to have [[EUV-FREQ]] updated accordingly.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the missing codes could be mapped to existing ones in [[EUV-FREQ]].</p>
<p>Another option is to use the corresponding URIs from <a href="https://github.com/ISO-TC211/GOM/blob/master/isotc211_GOM_harmonizedOntology/iso19115/2003/MaintenanceInformation.rdf">the relevant ISO 19115 ontology</a>, although they are not dereferenceable (as the ones currently used in GeoDCAT-AP) - namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>http://def.isotc211.org/iso19115/2003/MaintenanceInformation/code/MD_MaintenanceFrequencyCode/asNeeded</code></li>
<li><code>http://def.isotc211.org/iso19115/2003/MaintenanceInformation/code/MD_MaintenanceFrequencyCode/notPlanned</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There is however some work in ISO to set up a linked data registry, so it may eventually provide dereferenceable URIs, although the URIs may not necessarily correspond to the ones above.</p>
