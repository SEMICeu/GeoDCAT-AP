# GeoDCAT-AP

This is the issue tracker for the maintenance of GeoDCAT-AP.

GeoDCAT-AP is an extension of [DCAT-AP](http://data.europa.eu/w21/ac376c94-74cf-4dd7-ade7-267d6a4ec4dc) for describing geospatial datasets, dataset series, and services. It provides an RDF syntax binding for the union of metadata elements defined in the core profile of [ISO 19115:2003](https://www.iso.org/standard/26020.html) and those defined in the framework of the [EU INSPIRE Directive](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/). Its basic use case is to make spatial datasets, data series, and services searchable on general data portals, thereby making geospatial information better searchable across borders and sectors.

GeoDCAT-AP is a joint initiative of the [European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC)](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/), the [Publications Office of the European Union (PO)](https://publications.europa.eu/), the [EU ISA Programme](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/) and [DG CONNECT](https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/communications-networks-content-and-technology). More than 52 people from 12 EU Member States contributed to the specification in the Working Group or during the public review period.

The current version of GeoDCAT-AP (v1.0.1) can be downloaded from  https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/release/geodcat-ap/v101

*The GeoDCAT-AP specification does not replace the [INSPIRE Metadata Regulation](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/com/2008/1205) nor the [INSPIRE Metadata technical guidelines based on ISO 19115 and ISO 19119](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/id/document/tg/metadata-iso19139). Its purpose is give owners of geospatial metadata the possibility to achieve more by providing an additional RDF syntax binding.*
